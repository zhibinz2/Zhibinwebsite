summary: Abstract üëã How can we capture structure in high-dimensional behavioral and physiological data obtained from human subjects performing a teaming task? For example, EEG data is often collected across n bands at a high sampling rate. This results in large quantities of data points that live in n-dimensional (n-dim) space. One approach is use topological data analysis to identify and study the underlying structure of data. Topology is a field of mathematics concerned with the shape and connectivity of spaces. Mapper is a topological tool that allows the user investigate a dataset's connectivity [1]. The Mapper algorithm takes in high-dimensional data, projects it down to lower dimensional space, groups it there, and then applies those groupings to the original data points, where it connects clusters whenever two clusters contain a point, see (Fig. 1 -- top). Mapper allows for observation of underlying patterns and structure that are impossible to visualize or understand in the original space.

Mapper has been used previously by Saggar et. al, for example see [2], to analyze MRI data collected from five different tasks, instructions, working memory, video, math, and rest. The authors showed that Mapper could elucidate the relationship between behavior and the evolution of underlying brain states over time and across tasks and represent it in a hub-like network. Building on this work, we use Mapper to provide insight into a multi-human finger tapping teaming task that includes both behavioral and EEG data. Applying Mapper to understand properties from EEG time-series data as opposed to MRI data will require overcoming signal noise, artifacts, and the signal's non-linear nature.

We present results from data collected from a set of collaborative tapping tasks. Participants were paired off, isolated, and instructed to tap synchronously or syncopated to a metronome's beat. Next, subjects had to self-pace, pace off of their partner, lead their partner, or pace off of each other, depending on the trial. We analyzed EEG data across 32 different channels at a sample rate of 2000Hz, which yielded datasets consisting of ~800,000 data points in 32-dim space for each of the 12 trials. For each dataset, we fed the 32-dim data into Mapper where it projected it down to 2-dim using t-SNE. There, Mapper grouped the points in the 2-dim space and applied those groupings to the points in the 32-dim space. Finally, Mapper clustered the groups using DBSCAN and built a graph where clusters that contained the same points were connected, see (Fig. 1 -- bottom).

We observed structural differences between the Mapper graphs of the two tapper's brain states across all 12 tasks. Across time, one individual showed distinct partitioning between the self-led task and the other three tasks. Finally, the graphs exhibited hub-like behavior, similar to those referenced above by Sagger et. al [2].

## Abstract

1. How can we capture structure in high-dimensional behavioral and physiological data obtained from human subjects performing a teaming task? For example, EEG data is often collected across n bands at a high sampling rate. This results in large quantities of data points that live in n-dimensional (n-dim) space. One approach is use topological data analysis to identify and study the underlying structure of data. Topology is a field of mathematics concerned with the shape and connectivity of spaces. Mapper is a topological tool that allows the user investigate a dataset's connectivity [1]. The Mapper algorithm takes in high-dimensional data, projects it down to lower dimensional space, groups it there, and then applies those groupings to the original data points, where it connects clusters whenever two clusters contain a point, see (Fig. 1 -- top). Mapper allows for observation of underlying patterns and structure that are impossible to visualize or understand in the original space.
2. Mapper has been used previously by Saggar et. al, for example see [2], to analyze MRI data collected from five different tasks, instructions, working memory, video, math, and rest. The authors showed that Mapper could elucidate the relationship between behavior and the evolution of underlying brain states over time and across tasks and represent it in a hub-like network. Building on this work, we use Mapper to provide insight into a multi-human finger tapping teaming task that includes both behavioral and EEG data. Applying Mapper to understand properties from EEG time-series data as opposed to MRI data will require overcoming signal noise, artifacts, and the signal's non-linear nature.

3. We present results from data collected from a set of collaborative tapping tasks. Participants were paired off, isolated, and instructed to tap synchronously or syncopated to a metronome's beat. Next, subjects had to self-pace, pace off of their partner, lead their partner, or pace off of each other, depending on the trial. We analyzed EEG data across 32 different channels at a sample rate of 2000Hz, which yielded datasets consisting of ~800,000 data points in 32-dim space for each of the 12 trials. For each dataset, we fed the 32-dim data into Mapper where it projected it down to 2-dim using t-SNE.

Finally, Mapper clustered the groups using DBSCAN and built a graph where clusters that contained the same points were connected, see (Fig. 1 -- bottom).
