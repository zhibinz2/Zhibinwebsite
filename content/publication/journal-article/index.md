abstract: Cerebral ischemia is the pathophysiological condition in which the oxygenated cerebral blood flow is less than what is needed to meet cerebral metabolic demand. It is one of the most debilitating complications in the perioperative period and has serious clinical sequelae. The monitoring and prevention of intraoperative cerebral ischemia are crucial because an anesthetized patient in the operating room cannot be neurologically assessed. In this paper, we provide an overview of the definition, etiology, risk factors, and prevention of cerebral ischemia during surgery.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Cerebral ischemia is a hazardous pathophysiological condition during surgery and can lead to clinically debilitating consequences. Objective methods for monitoring and preventing cerebral ischemia during surgery are more meaningful because an anesthetized patient in the operating room cannot be neurologically evaluated. The risk factors relevant to perioperative cerebral ischemia should be recognized and risk reduction should be considered as early as possible before the planned surgery. A sound understanding of cerebrovascular physiology is fundamental to the prevention of intraoperative cerebral ischemia.
