We aim to investigate whether hemortheology and oxygenation balance are affected by intraoperative gelatin infusion, whether it poses a threat to the perioperative well-being of the patients, and thus creates difficult conditions for postanesthesia care.
Design
A randomized controlled clinical trial.
Methods
After anesthesia induction, 10 ml/kg succinylated gelatin was infused. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed, and whole blood viscosity and vital signs were recoded both before and after the infusion.
Findings
High shear and medium shear viscosities decreased (P = .003 and P = .04, respectively) after the infusion of both gelatin and Ringer's lactate. The peripheral vascular resistance was not significantly changed by the infusion of either fluid (P = .31). Ringer's lactate reduces the body's oxygen delivery index (P = .01).
Conclusions
Gelatin better maintains blood viscosity and stabilizes the body's oxygenation balance.},

	abstract = {Background
Postoperative renal impairment (RI) is one of the most common complications in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), and it occurs in 17\% to 95\% of the patients who undergo the surgery.
Methods
We reviewed 394 consecutive patients who underwent OLT. On the basis of the preoperative renal function level (presence of renal failure (RF): SCr {\textgreater}1.5 mg/dL before OLT), the patients were divided into an RF group and a non-RF group. In each group, the patients were subdivided into 4 subgroups according to the type and dosage of the intra-operative use of HES (hydroxyethyl starch). The changing tendency of the SCr (serum creatinine) of each group and the ratio of the change in the SCr within the first postoperative week were compared.
Results
In total, 139 of 394 patients (35\%) had RI within the first week after OLT (RI group); 104 patients (75\%) in the RI group and 181 patients (71\%) in the non-RI group required HES transfusions. The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified old age, a low pre-operative platelet level, and massive red blood cell transfusions as risk factors for the postoperative development of RI. The changing tendency of the SCr and the ratio of change in the SCr among the different HES subgroups showed no significant difference in the RF group or in the non-RF group.
Conclusions
Perioperative use of HES 200/0.5 or HES 130/0.4 has no significant effect on renal function in the first postoperative week in patients undergoing OLT.},

	abstract = {Background
Femoral nerve block (FNB) has been considered as an excellent analgesic modality in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) pain control. However, relatively high concentration of ropivacaine could lead to quadriceps muscle weakness and increase the risk of postoperative falls.

Objective
This double-blinded randomized controlled study was designed to investigate the effect of a combination of dexmedetomidine with a lower concentration of ropivacaine on quadriceps muscle strength and analgesic effect in FNB.

Methods
A total of 90 patients scheduled for TKA were randomized to receive continuous FNB postoperatively using 0.2\% ropivacaine (H group), 0.1\% ropivacaine (L group) or 0.1\% ropivacaine combined with 2 μg/kg dexmedetomidine (LD group). Meanwhile, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine was administered to patients. The primary endpoint was the strength of quadriceps muscle evaluated by manual muscle testing (MMT) and Timed Up and Go test (TUG). The secondary endpoint was the pain scores and morphine consumption among different groups.

Results
For MMT, LD group showed higher quadriceps muscle strength than the other two groups (P{\textless}0.05) at 12 hrs postoperatively. TUG test was conducted to measure the walking ability, and showed that scores were significantly better in LD group than those in H group and L group (P{\textless}0.05) at 24 and 48 hrs postoperatively. There was no significant difference between H and LD group in the numeric rating scales (NRS) scores both at rest and at 45° flexion. The total morphine consumption in L group was significantly higher than in H or LD group (P{\textless}0.001).

Conclusion
Collectively, the addition of dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg to 0.1\% ropivacaine preoperatively would preserve quadriceps muscle strength with satisfactory analgesia in patients undergoing TKA. (This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03658421).},

	abstract = {Background: 
Advances in ECMO have rapidly progressed in recent years; however, the clinical mortality rate remains high. This study aimed to identify the risk factors of ECMO in patients with cardiogenic shock.

Methods:
Data of patients with cardiogenic shock who received ECMO from January 2006 to August 2013 at the Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University were retrospectively analyzed. All patients with cardiogenic shock were divided into two groups according to whether death occurred in the hospital. The possible prognostic risk factors of ECMO were first obtained in a univariate analysis of the two groups, and the risk factors that affected the prognosis of patients who underwent ECMO were determined using a logistic regression analysis.

Results:
This study included 94 cardiogenic shock patients who were treated with ECMO. Overall, 59 patients were successfully weaned from ECMO, which accounted for 62.7\% of all patients. The multivariate analysis indicated that the independent risk factors associated with prognosis included ECMO timing (OR = 7.68; 95\% CI 1.60-37.01), the occurrence of postoperative MOF (OR = 2,823.09; 95\% CI 14.75-540,171.06), and the lactate level at weaning (OR = 493.17; 95\% CI: 1.55-156,653.27).

Conclusion:
For patients with refractory cardiogenic shock, the early establishment of ECMO, improvement in perfusion, and the prevention of complications may improve the prognosis.},

We studied whether the most commonly used anesthetic drugs have negative effects on rat BMSCs in vitro.Materials and methodsThe cultured BMSCs were treated with sevoflurane (in 1.7\%, 2.3\%, and 3\%); propofol (5 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml); or 2.3\% sevoflurane plus 10 μg/ml propofol. After 4-hour treatment, the cultured BMSCs were prepared for MTT reduction assays and cell morphology observation.ResultsCompared to the controls, the 4-hour sevoflurane exposure resulted in decreased cell viability of BMSCs in a concentration-dependent manner; however, 1.7\% sevoflurane did not reduce the cell viability. The 4-hour propofol treatment did not affect the cell viability; but combined usage of 2.3\% sevoflurane and 10 μg/ml propofol decreased cell viability. In BMSCs treated with higher concentration of sevoflurane (1.7\% and 2.3\%) and combined usage of the two anesthetics, the cell became raritas with wizened cytoplasm and had fewer connections to each other of BMSCs. More than 2.3\%, or 2.3\% sevoflurane plus 10 μg/ ml propofol caused cytotoxicity to BMSCs. However, propofol up to 20 μg/ml did not harm the BMSCs.ConclusionsThe study indicates that it is necessary to choose the right anesthesia during the BMSCs transplantation therapy.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveTo report a case of propofol-induced rhabdomyolysis. In this case, widespread myolysis was detected after induction of anesthesia.Case summaryA 54-year-old female patient was scheduled for a hysterectomy. Beginning shortly after the induction of anesthesia with propofol, several episodes of ventricular fibrillation occurred. Despite intensive care, the patient failed to recover. During most episodes of ventricular fibrillation, marked hyperthermia or hyperkalemia were not observed. Unexplained, widespread myolysis affecting both skeletal and cardiac muscle was observed at autopsy.DiscussionIn this patient, the evidence for rhabdomyolysis is robust. Clinical characteristics are similar to those observed in propofol infusion syndrome. The absence of a body temperature over 40 °C precludes the possibility of malignant hyperthermia. Widespread rhabdomyolysis locations cannot be explained by precordial electric shocks. Propofol is the only drug used in this case that has been reported to induce rhabodomyolysis.ConclusionsSigns of propofol-induced rhabdomyolysis may be different from those of malignant hyperthermia. Even a regular induction dose of propofol for adults could possibly trigger rhabdomyolysis similar to what is observed in children diagnosed with propofol infusion syndrome. Though rare, care should still be taken when administering propofol.},

Whether the pharmacokinetic model by Marsh or the one by Schnider will produce better hemodynamic stability remains unclear. This study compared hemodynamic changes during induction between the two models.Methods60 patients who underwent elective surgery were randomly assigned to plasma target-controlled infusion by Marsh's (n = 30) or Schnider's (n = 30) model with an initial target concentration of 4 μg×mL-1. The target was then reset and gradually titrated to a sedation level with a narcotrend index (NI) below 64. Stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, arterial pressure, target, and effect site concentration, and dose of propofol infused were recorded every minute during the first 25 minutes of infusion.ResultsThroughout the first 25 minutes, stroke volume index and cardiac index were decreased significantly in both Marsh and Schnider groups, but no statistical difference was detected between the groups (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Central venous pressure (CVP), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and heart rate (HR) did not significantly change during induction (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Time to loss of responsiveness (LOR), and time for NI to decrease to 64 was faster in Marsh than in Schnider (1.51 ± 0.8 minutes vs. 2.8 ± 1.2 min, p ConclusionsWhen target concentrations are titrated according to NI during induction of anesthesia, Marsh's model could induce sedation faster than Schnider's. Meanwhile, hemodynamic changes were not observed to be statistically different between the two models. Hypotension induced by plasma target-controlled infusion of propofol could mainly be attributed to decreased stroke volume instead of vascular dilation.},

	abstract = {Sevoflurane is generally considered a pro-apoptotic agent in the neonatal brain. However, recent studies have suggested that low levels of sevoflurane anesthesia may be neuroprotective and have a memory enhancing effect. The present study aimed to investigate whether sevoflurane exerts a neuroprotective effect at subclinical concentrations, with regard to oxidative state. In the current study, postnatal day 7 (P7) Sprague‑Dawley rats were continuously exposed to 0.3, 1.3, or 2.3\% sevoflurane for 6 h. ELISA was used to quantify the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH‑px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the plasma and the hippocampus. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining was used to observe hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. Altered object exploration tests for recognition memory were employed to investigate long‑term behavioral effects at postnatal day 28. The results demonstrated that a single 6 h exposure to a subclinical concentration (1.3\%) of sevoflurane at P7 reduces MDA and GPH‑px production in rats. Sevoflurane induced hippocampal apoptosis in a dose‑dependent manner and altered recognition memory testing indicated no differences among the groups. Although early exposure to a subclinical concentration of sevoflurane reduced oxidative stress, it did not prevent the process of sevoflurane-induced hippocampal apoptosis. These changes did not affect subsequent recognition memory in juvenile rats.},

On P35, the rats neonatally exposed to 1.2\% sevoflurane showed better behavioral results than control rats, but not in the 2.4\% sevo group. Exposure to 1.2\% sevoflurane increased the number of 5′-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and improved both synaptic number and ultrastructure in the hippocampus. The expression levels of BDNF, TrkB, postsynaptic density (PSD)-95, and synaptophysin in the hippocampus were also increased in the 1.2\% sevo group. In contrast, no significant changes in neurogenesis or synaptic plasticity were observed between the C group and the 2.4\% sevo group on P35. These results showed that exposure of the developing brain to a low concentration of sevoflurane for 6 h could promote spatial learning and memory function, along with increased hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, in later life.},

Our study investigated two commonly used anesthetics—sevoflurane and propofol—for neurotoxicity in young children. Forty-seven children (aged 12–36 months) undergoing hypospadias repair surgery were randomized to receive sevoflurane (SG, n = 24) or propofol (PG, n = 23) general anesthesia. Venous blood was collected at three different times—immediately after induction, 2 h, and 3 days after surgery. The cellular portion was assessed for antioxidant defense and DNA damage, using enzyme assay kits and qRT-PCR, respectively, while serum was used to treat cultured neural stem cells (NSCs). MTT assay and TUNEL staining were performed, and the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and apoptosis indicators were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Antioxidant defense and apoptosis status in the SG group were significantly higher than in the PG group at 2 h after surgery. Additionally, exposure of NSCs to postoperative serum of the SG group resulted in decreased cell density and viability, increased TUNEL-positive cells, elevated mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes, and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Our data shows for the first time that in young children, administration of sevoflurane, but not propofol, leads to temporally increased antioxidant defense and apoptosis status as well as damage of NSCs.},

	abstract = {The commonly used volatile anesthetic sevoflurane has been shown to induce widespread apoptosis in the developing brain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Accumulating research has demonstrated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate multiple biological processes, including neural development, differentiation and apoptosis. They are aberrantly expressed in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we employed a lncRNA-mRNA microarray analysis to determine whether and how lncRNAs are involved in sevoflurane-induced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in neonatal mice. Our data showed that a single 6-h sevoflurane exposure of P7 mice resulted in significant morphological changes and apoptosis in the hippocampus. Moreover, the microarray simultaneously revealed 817 lncRNAs and 856 of their potential coding targets that related to apoptosis, of which 31 lncRNAs (19 up and 12 down) and 25 mRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (P {\textless} 0.05) after sevoflurane exposure. Importantly, we found that Bcl2l11 (BIM), which potentiates mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and its nearby enhancer-like lncRNA ENSMUST00000136025, were both more highly expressed in sevoflurane-treated samples compared with control samples. Subsequent qRT-PCR results confirmed the changes. Further CNC network indicated that lncRNA ENSMUST00000136025 was positively correlated with Bim. Moreover, sevoflurane induced a significant increase of pro-apoptotic protein BIM and Bax but a reduction of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 in the hippocampus. Our study first demonstrates that aberrantly expressed lncRNAs play a role in sevoflurane-induced hippocampal apoptosis. We noted that up-regulated ENSMUST00000136025 highly likely induced the over-expression of BIM, which eventually promoted mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Such findings further broaden the understanding of molecular mechanisms responsible for sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is shown to be effective on analgesia following cesarean section. This study aimed to compare the effects of three practical QLB approaches and classic epidural analgesia (EA) for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.

Patients and methods
Parturients undergoing elective cesarean section were randomized as group 1 (QLB type 2), group 2 (QLB type 3), group 3 (QLB type 2+3) and group 4 (EA). The block was performed at the end of the operation, and the epidural group was given a single epidural bolus. All subjects were provided with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia under identical settings. In addition, the postoperative pain severity was assessed by the VAS, which together with the morphine consumption at specific time intervals, was recorded within 48 hrs after surgery. Data were collected from December 2017 to June 2018.

Results
A total of 94 parturients had completed the study. At almost all postoperative time points, the VAS scores at rest and with movement in QLB type 2+3 group were lower than those in QLB type 2 or 3 group. The mean additional morphine consumption in QLB type 2+3 group (2.7 mg) was lower than that in QLB type 2 or 3 group (6.1 mg and 5.7 mg, respectively) within 48 h after surgery (P{\textless}0.001). Besides, the total morphine consumption in EA group (1.3 mg) was lower than that in any other QLB group (P{\textless}0.001).

Conclusions
The analgesic effect of QLB is highly dependent on the injection position of local anesthetic. Besides, the ultrasound-guided QLB type 2+3 can provide superior analgesic effect following cesarean section to that of QLB type 2 or 3 block. However, it remains to be further validated about whether the combination of QLB type 2 and 3 is the best approach.},

	abstract = {The commonly used inhalation anesthetic, sevoflurane, has been previously demonstrated to induce apoptosis in the developing brain; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve important roles in multiple physiological/pathological processes, such as cell death and survival. In the present study, the miRNA sequence that was most closely associated with sevoflurane‑induced apoptosis in the hippocampus of neonatal rat brains was identified. Seven‑day‑old Sprague Dawley rats were first exposed to 2.3\% sevoflurane for 6 h. Hippocampal brain tissues were harvested at 6 h following sevoflurane exposure. Cleaved caspase‑3 levels were examined using an immunofluorescence assay. Alterations in miRNA expression were assessed by microarray analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein levels of p53, phosphorylated (p)‑p53, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bax were assessed by western blot analysis. Sevoflurane exposure significantly increased the levels of cleaved caspase‑3 in the hippocampus. In addition, among the 688 miRNAs that were observed to be expressed in the hippocampus, sevoflurane exposure altered the expression levels of 266 miRNAs. Among these differentially expressed miRNAs, eight were significantly upregulated and one (miRNA‑34c) was significantly downregulated following sevoflurane exposure. Bioinformatics analyses indicated the miRNA‑34c was a direct downstream target of p53. Sevoflurane exposure induced significant alterations in the level of p‑p53, Bcl‑2 and Bax in the hippocampus of neonatal rats. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that miRNA‑34c may be regulated by p53 and is involved in sevoflurane‑induced neural apoptosis in the hippocampus of developing rat brains, potentially via the mitochondrial pathway.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of hypothermia under general anesthesia in a large domestic hospital.
Method
All of the consecutive 1840 patients who underwent scheduled surgery between August and December 2013 were admitted to the study. The nasopharyngeal temperature was measured, and the following variables were also recorded: sex, age, type of surgery, duration of anesthesia, active warming devices and type of operating room. Univariate and multiple regression binary logistic analyses with odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were used to assess the relationship between each clinical risk factor and hypothermia.
Results
The prevalence of hypothermia under general anesthesia was 25.7\%. In the univariate analysis, the risk factors of hypothermia were age, the duration of anesthesia, the type of operating room and the type of surgery. Sex was not included. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, the significant risk factors of hypothermia were advanced age, laminar airflow operating rooms and general surgeries.
Conclusion
Intraoperative hypothermia is still common and should therefore receive serious attention. Advanced age, the use of a laminar airflow operating room and general surgeries are high risk factors of hypothermia.},

In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day (P)7 were exposed to 2.3\% sevoflurane for 6 h continuously. Six hours after exposure, hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining was used to determine the morphological changes in the hippocampus. The expression levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and caspase-3 in the hippocampus of the pups were determined by immunofluorescence. A single 6-h sevoflurane exposure at P7 caused morphological changes in the hippocampus. Sevoflurane also significantly increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and reduced the expression of the nNOS protein.
